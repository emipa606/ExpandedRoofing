Adds customizable roofing, with transparent greenhouse roofing and photovoltaic solar roofing. Reworked from Vendan's original idea.
A direct port of the [url=https://github.com/AaronCRobinson/ExpandedRoofing]Github version made by [b]AaronCRobinson.[/b][/url] I take no credit for anything made in this mod.
[b]Works on 0.19.0 as well as 1.0.0.[/b]

[h1]Bug reporting[/h1]
I'm putting this at the top to clear up some confusion.
The Steam workshop comments aren't the location to report bugs for this mod. I don't own this mod, and Why_Is_That, the actual owner, doesn't read the comments here. If you have a bug that you feel needs fixing, please report it on the [b][url=https://github.com/AaronCRobinson/ExpandedRoofing]Github page[/url][/b]

[h1]Features[/h1]
- Transparent roofs that let almost all light through
- Solar roofs and controllers that can be used to generate power
- Removal of thick roofs
- Thick roofs (which require maintenance as of Late A17/B18)
- 4 new techs to research for each of these features.
- Disables settings when `Don't Tempt Me!` is enabled (Vassteel Rydex's request)

[h1]Solar Roofing and Controllers explained[/h1]
- Each controller has a max output of 2500w
- Each solar tile produces 200w during full sun
- There is no limit to the number of controllers connected to a section of tiles

[h1]Roof Maintenance[/h1]
- Maintenance required for thick roofs (only)
- Maintenance is a long tick (once every 2000 ticks)
- Maintenance is required after 5000 ticks (~167 days)
- After 7500 ticks collapses can occur by MTB event. (~250 days)
- MTB event is set for 3.5 days.
- These numbers are subject to change.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
- Is compatible with any existing B19 save with no other roofing mods
- It's recommended to have this mod load early in your mod load order

[h1]Notes[/h1]
- New designators are in the `Zone` tab
- Due to how roofs are implement, it's easiest to rezone default roofing to new types

[h1]Translations[/h1]
- English
- Turkish (by Slevilex)
- Russian (by Garr Incorporated, updated by lex1975)
- French (by Jozay)
- Chinese (by Rosenmund and 不为人知的汉子)
- Japanese (by mundane_m)

[h1]Acknowledgements[/h1]

Thank to Erdelf for getting me back on track and Xen for designator artwork.

Special thanks to Pardeike's amazing non-destructive patching library, Harmony.
